            ### RxRadar Data Privacy and Consent Policy

            At RxRadar, your privacy and control over your health data are our highest priorities. This policy outlines how your data is handled and your rights.

            **1. Patient Data Collection:**
            * **Medication Information:** We collect medication names, dosages, and frequencies that you input into the application. This data is essential for providing medication interaction and duplication alerts.

            **2. Data Usage:**
            * Your medication information is used solely for the purpose of analyzing potential drug interactions, duplicates, and providing relevant health alerts.
            * We **do not** use your personal health information for marketing, advertising, or any purpose unrelated to the direct functionality of RxRadar.
            * **No Sale of Data:** Your personal health data will never be sold to third parties.

            **3. Data Anonymization and Aggregation:**
            * **Anonymized Usage Data:** We may collect anonymized, aggregated usage data (e.g., number of analyses performed, types of alerts generated) to improve the application's performance and features.
            * Whenever possible, data used for analytical improvements or research will be de-identified and aggregated so that it cannot be associated with any individual. This process ensures your privacy while allowing us to enhance the service for all users.

            **4. Data Access:**
            * Access to your personal medication data is strictly limited to authorized personnel directly involved in maintaining and operating the RxRadar service, and only when necessary for troubleshooting or support, under strict confidentiality agreements.
            * We employ robust security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit, to protect your data from unauthorized access.

            **5. Your Control Over Your Data:**
            * **Access and Review:** You have the right to access and review the medication data you have provided at any time within the application.
            * **Correction:** You can correct or update your medication information as needed.
            * **Deletion:** You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all associated personal medication data. Upon such a request, we will permanently delete your data in accordance with applicable laws and our data retention policies.
            * **Consent Withdrawal:** By checking the box below, you provide consent for RxRadar to process your data as described in this policy. You can withdraw this consent at any time by contacting our support. Please note that withdrawing consent may limit or terminate your ability to use certain features of the application.
